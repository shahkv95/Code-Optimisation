# Code Optimization
This repository is created to focus on code optimization. Today in the world of programming, where everywhere - everything is getting coded. It is very important to write optimized code. We need to focus on various complexities involved in the code.


<b>I will update the readme.md file soon. Till then you can work on the issues if you wishes to. </b>

# Repository Structure:

# Optimization Techniques
         * Technique_Name (Save file by the name of the technique)
                

## Format for writing Optimization Techniques: 
* Technique Name<br>
* How to apply<br> 
* Time / Space complexity<br>
* Acknowledgement - References

# Research Papers
This folder contains all the available links of research paper for a particular optimization algorithm. 

## Format of including Research Paper 
* Consider one Optimization Technique and include as many research paper links as you can find and include them year wise. <br>
* If you are working for Swarm Optimization Technique, open 2019, write its name and link and do the same for other years as well.<br>
* If in case you do not find any links, still write the name of the technique and mention NONE under it.<br>
* This will make it easy to access for everyone.<br>
* The sequence would thus be maintained for it.


# Use Cases
This folder contains the use cases / algorithms for the code optimization. 
## Structure to be followed
* Usecases 
* Collection 1(Searching) 
* Algorithm_name (Binary Search)
1) Optimized Code
2) Pseudo Code
3) List of Techniques known / compared
